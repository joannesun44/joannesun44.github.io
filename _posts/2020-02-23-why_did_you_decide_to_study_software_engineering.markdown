The reason I want to be a software engineer listed as follows.

First of all, I am good at troubleshooting. I heard that problem solving is the core part of programming. When encounter problems, I like to clarify the problem in detail and then break down large problems into smaller problems. This way, I got several less difficult sub-problems to solve. Most of time, I would like to draw a decision tree to branch out each steps. Doing so helps me quickly diagnose issues and form strategies to sovle problem. 

Second of all, I love to logic thinking. This is a very important skill for software engineers. Logic thinking is a creative endeavor which strengthen my creativity by strengthening my right brain thinking. I think deeply and analytically about something every day. I frequently ask myself "what is the logic behind this?" and "what is the strategy?"

Third, I always look at the big picture first before sovling problems. Getting the sight of big picture helps me better understand  the problem, sort out the problem and find the answer. This also helps me understand while looking at the same thing, people from different angle got different point of view.   

Last, I love coding. I play sudoku everyday.  I always form different strategy and try different way to sovle the puzzle faster and even faster. I like to challenge myself. Coding is a game to me. I like to play Grasshopper and SoloLearn on my cell phone just like play sudoku. It is fun.
